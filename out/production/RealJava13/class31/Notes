What is FileHandling :
 Readin/Writing data to a file is called handling
 Why File Handling Is Important :
  The data change frequently we dont put that data with code bcs if we have to change that
  data we need to recompile code and redeploy the code on production servers again. Its very
  lengthy process and maight take weeks. The other issue is we might accidentally change the code
  as well when changing the data and might introduce bugs.
How to Handle files in Java :
 1) We need to know the path of the files.
 2) Navigate to that location using FileInputStream if we are planning to read the data
 from a file and FileOutPutStream if we are planning to write the data from a file
