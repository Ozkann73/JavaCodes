Exception in java:
  Exception is unwanted behaviour fro  the application that disrupts the normal
  flow of application.

Exception Handling :
 It is converting the complex system error messages to user friendly error messages.
 easier to understand for every user. We provide back up code that can be used if
 our primary logic fails.

Why we should Handle Exeptions :
  1) To make the software user-friendly
  2) It helps us make more robust (better) applications
  3) We can figure out the exact line numbers and issues that are causing
  problems in our code (Most important for all types of programmers)

What is the syntax for Exception Handling :
 We have new keywords like try, catch,finally, throw, throws keywors

 try {
we put the part of the code that can cause exception (problematic code)
 }catch(Create a variable of the class who's exception can be thrown){
We put the back up code here
 }

 For Example we are trying to read a file;

 String path ="";
 try {
 FileInputStream files = new FileInputStream(path);
 Properties pro = Properties();
 pro.load(files)
 }catch(IOException io){
 System.out.println("Please check the file at he path");
 }
